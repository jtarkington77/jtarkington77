# Hi, I’m Jeremy Tarkington

**Systems Engineer & B.S. Cybersecurity Student (WGU)**  
Building **realistic blue-team home labs, phishing/OSINT workflows, and security tooling** — then documenting the process in public.

## 🔭 What I’m Building Here

- **CyberLab** – My full cyber lab setup: virtualization host, networks, and workflow notes for day-to-day experimentation and practice.
- **Home-Lab-Samba-AD-Wazuh** – Enterprise-style home lab with Windows AD, Samba, and Wazuh SIEM for log collection, detection engineering, and blue-team practice.
- **VenomousViper** *(private releasing soon)* – A Windows triage and persistence toolkit focused on incident response and endpoint analysis.
- **Phishing & OSINT Projects**
  - `phishing-osint-orphanageatd` – OSINT + phishing-recon workflows and experiments.
  - `phishing-analysis-opencase` – Structured analysis of phishing incidents and how to break them down like a case file.
- **thm-htb-writeups** – Earlier TryHackMe / Hack The Box write-ups kept for history and reference.

I’m using this GitHub mainly as a **proof-of-work log** for my security journey: home lab builds, write-ups, and tools that I actually use.
